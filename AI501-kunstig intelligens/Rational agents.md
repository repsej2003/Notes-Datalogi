# Defention of agents
1. agents exists in a constraind task envirmet
2. it has sensors to perceive the environemet
3. it has acturars to interact with the enivmet 
4. it has a task to perfom


### Defitnit percept
A percept is the agent's information provided by a sensor
the percept sequence is a squence og percept

# Defention agent function
an agent function is a map from percept sequences to actions
the agent program is an implementatoin of the agent function on physical rchitecture


# How can agent be rational
* Perfrmance measure
* well defin, that the agent can do
* acction depend on percept sequence
* agent may have som pror knowledge of the environment

### Defention of Ratonal agent
An agent is rational if it select an action that is expected to maximse its performance measure for each possible percept sequnce, given the evidence procied by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.


Der kan være forskel på forvent performace messauce og det rigtige performace

learning = adapt the behacio of the afent is based on experience
autonomy = the agtens is capable of learn and not completelt depend on the prior knowledge

# PEAS
- Performance measure: evaulte succes
- Environment: the world the agent opreats in
- Actuartors: how it act 
- Sensor: how it percept the
-
