# Neuron (Perceptron)

A neuron, in the original form introduced as the **perceptron** [Rosenblatt (1958)](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0042519)<!-- cite: rosenblatt1958perceptron | article | author={Rosenblatt, Frank}; title={The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model for Information Storage and Organization in the Brain}; journal={Psychological Review}; year={1958}; volume={65}; number={6}; pages={386--408} -->, is the basic unit of a neural network. A neuron identified by index $j$ has the following structure:
$$
\begin{aligned}
 z &= w_j^T x + b_j \\
 h &= g(z).
\end{aligned}
$$
Above,
  - $x$ is the input vector,
  - $w_j$ is the weight vector, which correspond to the synapses of the neuron that admit input signals from the previous layer,
  - $g$ is the activation function that determines whether the neuron is activated or not,
  - $b_j$ is the bias, which is a constant,
  - $z$ is the linear activation of the neuron,
  - $h$ is the activation output of the neuron.

```

The first-generation activation function was the Heaviside step function:

$$g(z) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } z \geq 0, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}$$

This construction, called a **perceptron**, is not popular nowadays since it is not differentiable. Modern neural networks use differentiable activation functions such as:

- Sigmoid function: $g(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$,
- Hyperbolic tangent function: $g(z) = \tanh(z)$,
- Rectified linear unit (ReLU): $g(z) = \max(0, z)$.

# Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron)

A neural network is a collection of neurons. The neurons are organized in layers such that the activation output of the neurons in one layer become the synaptic inputs of the next layer.

```{=latex}
\input{fig/neural_network.tex}
```

The operation of $k$ neurons sharing the same layer $l$ on the $i$ th can be given in the vector form below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 z_n^l &= W_l^\top h_n^{l-1} + b^l, \\
 h_n^l &= g(z_n^l),
\end{aligned}
$$

where 

$$W_l= \begin{bmatrix} w_1^l & w_2^l & \cdots & w_k^l \end{bmatrix}$$

is the matrix of weight vectors and 

$$b^l=(b_1^l, \ldots, b_k^l)$$

is the vector of biases. The vector $h_n^l$ is called the **activation map** of layer $l$ for the $n$-th input. For $l=0$, the activation map is the input vector $x$, i.e. $h_n^0 := x_n$. The final pre-activation $z_n^H$ is the output $\widehat{y}_n$ of the neural network.

Assume we have a neural network with two layers. We can express its whole operation as:

$$\widehat{y}_n = W_2^\top g(W_1^\top x_n + b^1) + b^2.$$

Likewise, we can express the operation of a neural network with three layers as:

$$\widehat{y}_n = W_3^\top g(W_2^\top g(W_1^\top x_n + b^1) + b^2) + b^3.$$

# Training a Neural Network: Backpropagation

As other machine learning models we covered thus far, neural networks are also trained to minimize a loss function. Denote the loss function by $\ell(y, \widehat{y})$ for a prediction $\widehat{y}$ and the true value $y$. Due to the cascaded application of the nonlinear activation functions, the loss function is not convex. Therefore, we cannot find the optimal solution analytically. Instead, we use gradient descent:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  w_{ij}^l := w_{ij}^l - \alpha \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial w_{ij}^l},
\end{aligned}
$$

for all synaptic connections $i \rightarrow j$ in all layers $l$. Given a neural network with $H$ layers, define $\widehat{y}_j = z_j^H$ as the output of the $j$ th neuron in the last layer. Also define

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \delta_j^l = \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial z_j^l}.
\end{aligned}
$$

This expression is called the **error** of the $j$ th neuron in the $l$ th layer. To see why, consider the case where $l=H$ and the loss function is the mean squared error: $\ell(y, \widehat{y}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j} (y_j - \widehat{y}_j)^2$. Then we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \delta_j^H &= \frac{\partial \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j} (y_j - \widehat{y}_j)^2}{\partial z_j^H} \\
  &= \frac{\partial \frac{1}{2} (y_j - \widehat{y}_j)^2}{\partial \widehat{y}_j}\\
  &= \widehat{y}_j - y_j.
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the error of the prediction of the neural network on the $j$ output channel. The gradient of the loss with respect to an arbitrary weight is

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial w_{ij}^l} &= \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial z_j^l} \frac{\partial z_j^l}{\partial w_{ij}^l} \\
  &= \delta_j^l \frac{\partial z_j^l}{\partial w_{ij}^l}\\
  &= \delta_j^l h_i^{l-1}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Let us next calculate the error for an intermediate layer $l$. We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \delta_j^l &= \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial z_j^l} \\
  &= \sum_{k} \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial z_k^{l+1}} \frac{\partial z_k^{l+1}}{\partial z_j^l} \\
  &= \sum_{k} \delta_k^{l+1} \frac{\partial z_k^{l+1}}{\partial z_j^l}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $k$ ranges over the neurons in the next layer. Place the definition of $z_k^{l+1}$ into the above equation, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
 \frac{\partial z_k^{l+1}}{\partial z_j^l} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial z_j^l} \left( \sum_{j'} w_{j'k}^{l+1} g(z_{j'}^l) + b_{k}^{l+1} \right) \\
  &= w_{jk}^{l+1} \frac{\partial g(z_j^l)}{\partial z_j^l}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Placing this result into the above expression about the derivative of the error, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \delta_j^l &=  \frac{\partial g(z_j^l)}{\partial z_j^l} \sum_{k} \delta_k^{l+1} w_{jk}^{l+1} 
\end{aligned}
$$

This way we obtain a recursive formula for the error of a neuron in an intermediate layer, where the recursion applies in the backward direction of the layers. There are remarkable facts regarding the computational efficiency of this formula that are first observed by Rumelhart et al. in 1986 and made the training of multilayer neural networks feasible:

 - It requires only $z_j^l$, which is already calculated during the forward pass.
 - Its computational cost is linear to the number of neurons in the network, i.e. $O(|W|)$ where $|W|$ is the number of weights in the network.

 The findings above can be put together into an algorithm and expressed as below.

1. Set $h^0 = x$ (the activation map of the input layer is the input itself).

2. **Forward Pass.** For $l=1 \rightarrow H$ do:
    - Compute and save $z_j^l = \sum_{i} w_{ij}^l h_i^{l-1} + b_j^l$ for every neuron $j$ in layer $l$.
    - If $l < H$, compute $h_j^l = g(z_j^l)$. If $l = H$, the network output is $\widehat{y}_j := z_j^H$.

3. **Backward Pass.** For $l=H \rightarrow 1$ do:
    - Compute $\delta_j^l = \frac{\partial g(z_j^l)}{\partial z_j^l} \sum_{k} \delta_k^{l+1} w_{jk}^{l+1}$ for every neuron $j$ in layer $l$ (for $l=H$, use $\delta_j^H = \widehat{y}_j - y_j$ directly, as derived above).
    - Compute $\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial w_{ij}^l} = \delta_j^l h_i^{l-1}$ for every synaptic connection $i \rightarrow j$.

This algorithm is called **backpropagation** [Rumelhart et al. (1986)](https://doi.org/10.1038/323533a0)<!-- cite: rumelhart1986learning | article | author={Rumelhart, David E. and Hinton, Geoffrey E. and Williams, Ronald J.}; title={Learning Representations by Back-Propagating Errors}; journal={Nature}; year={1986}; volume={323}; pages={533--536} -->. The name comes after the notion that the error term $\delta_j^l$ is propagated backward from the output layer to the input layer.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

Above we explained the backpropagation algorithm for a single data point for simplicity. For a data set with $m$ samples, the gradient descent algorithm becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 w_{ij}^l := w_{ij}^l - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{\partial \ell(y_i, \widehat{y}_i)}{\partial w_{ij}^l},
\end{aligned}
$$

This means we need to do a forward pass and a backward pass for all weights and all data points. This is computationally expensive for large data sets. Instead, we can use a technique called **stochastic gradient descent**. In this technique, we use a subset of the data set, called a **mini-batch**, to calculate the gradient. The size of the mini-batch is denoted by $b$. The stochastic gradient descent algorithm can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
   B &\subseteq S, \quad |B| = b, \quad B \text{ drawn uniformly at random} \\
  w_{ij}^l &:= w_{ij}^l - \alpha \frac{1}{b} \sum_{i=1}^b \frac{\partial \ell(y_i, \widehat{y}_i)}{\partial w_{ij}^l},
\end{aligned}
$$

where the first step draws a mini-batch $B$ uniformly at random from the **training set** $S$ — not from the data distribution $\mathcal{D}$, which we cannot sample from — and the second step performs a gradient descent update using the backpropagation algorithm. The random selection makes the gradient signal a random variable. This is why the algorithm is called stochastic gradient descent. Because $B$ is drawn uniformly from $S$, this random variable is an unbiased estimate of the full-batch gradient over $S$, i.e. of the gradient of the empirical risk $\widehat{R}_S$. Hence, under mild conditions (a suitably decaying learning rate $\alpha$, among others) clarified by [Robbins and Monro (1951)](https://doi.org/10.1214/aoms/1177729586)<!-- cite: robbins1951stochastic | article | author={Robbins, Herbert and Monro, Sutton}; title={A Stochastic Approximation Method}; journal={The Annals of Mathematical Statistics}; year={1951}; volume={22}; number={3}; pages={400--407} -->, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the loss, just as deterministic gradient descent is. Since the neural network loss is generally non-convex, owing to the cascaded, nonlinear composition of layers described above, neither algorithm is guaranteed to reach the *same* stationary point, or the global optimum; in practice the noise injected by the mini-batch sampling is even considered beneficial, as it helps the iterate escape poor local stationary points that plain gradient descent could get stuck in.

## Backpropagation in Matrix Form

The scalar recursion above is what one implements on paper; what one implements on a computer is its **batched matrix** form, which processes all $b$ examples of a mini-batch $B$ in one pass and maps one-to-one onto the code of the next section. Stack the activation maps of the mini-batch as rows,

$$\begin{gathered}
\mathbf{H}^{l} := \begin{bmatrix} (h_1^{l})^\top \\ \vdots \\ (h_b^{l})^\top \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{b \times k_l}, \\
\mathbf{H}^0 := \mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{b\times d},
\end{gathered}$$

and collect the layer errors in the same layout, $\mathbf{\Delta}^l := \partial \widehat{R}_B / \partial \mathbf{Z}^l \in \mathbb{R}^{b \times k_l}$, whose $(n,j)$-th entry is the error $\delta_j^l$ of neuron $j$ on example $n$. Then the entire algorithm is six matrix identities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\textbf{(F1)}\quad \mathbf{Z}^l &= \mathbf{H}^{l-1} W_l + \mathbf{1}_b (b^l)^\top, & W_l &\in \mathbb{R}^{k_{l-1}\times k_l}, \\
\textbf{(F2)}\quad \mathbf{H}^l &= g(\mathbf{Z}^l) & &\text{(elementwise)}, \\
\textbf{(B1)}\quad \mathbf{\Delta}^H &= \tfrac{1}{b}\big(\widehat{\mathbf{Y}} - \mathbf{Y}\big), & &\text{(output layer)}\\
\textbf{(B2)}\quad \mathbf{\Delta}^{l-1} &= \big(\mathbf{\Delta}^{l} W_l^\top\big) \odot g'(\mathbf{Z}^{l-1}), & &\text{(recursion)}\\
\textbf{(B3)}\quad \partial \widehat{R}_B / \partial W_l &= (\mathbf{H}^{l-1})^\top \mathbf{\Delta}^l, & &\\
\textbf{(B4)}\quad \partial \widehat{R}_B / \partial b^l &= (\mathbf{\Delta}^l)^\top \mathbf{1}_b, & &
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\odot$ is the elementwise (Hadamard) product and $\mathbf{1}_b \in \mathbb{R}^b$ is the all-ones vector. (F1)-(F2) are the forward pass; (B1)-(B4) are the backward pass. Two observations:

* **(B3) is the scalar rule $\partial \ell/\partial w_{ij}^l = \delta_j^l h_i^{l-1}$, summed over the mini-batch** — the matrix product $(\mathbf{H}^{l-1})^\top\mathbf{\Delta}^l$ performs exactly that sum, which is why one gradient step costs one matrix multiplication per layer rather than $|W|$ scalar operations. (The averaging factor $1/b$ that turns the sum into the mini-batch mean has already been folded into $\mathbf{\Delta}^H$ by (B1), so it needs no separate mention here.)
* **(B2) is the scalar recursion $\delta_j^l = g'(z_j^l)\sum_k \delta_k^{l+1} w_{jk}^{l+1}$** — the sum over the next layer's neurons $k$ is the product with $W_l^\top$, and multiplying by $g'$ is the Hadamard product. Every layer therefore needs exactly two things from its forward pass: its input $\mathbf{H}^{l-1}$ (for B3) and its pre-activation $\mathbf{Z}^{l}$ (for $g'$ in B2). This is the entire content of the "cache the forward pass" instruction in the algorithm above.

**(B1) for the softmax cross-entropy loss.** We derived $\delta_j^H = \widehat{y}_j - y_j$ for the squared loss. For $C$-class classification the output layer is instead passed through a **softmax**,

$$\begin{gathered}
\widehat{y}_j := \frac{\exp(z_j^H)}{\sum_{c=1}^C \exp(z_c^H)}, \\
\ell(y,\widehat{y}) := -\sum_{c=1}^C y_c \log \widehat{y}_c \quad (y \text{ one-hot}),
\end{gathered}$$

and a short calculation gives the *same* form. Writing $\widehat y_j = \exp(z_j)/Z$ with $Z := \sum_c \exp(z_c)$,

$$\begin{gathered}
\frac{\partial \widehat{y}_c}{\partial z_j^H} = \widehat{y}_c\big(\mathds{1}(c{=}j) - \widehat{y}_j\big) \\
\Longrightarrow\quad \frac{\partial \ell}{\partial z_j^H} = -\sum_{c} \frac{y_c}{\widehat y_c}\,\widehat{y}_c\big(\mathds{1}(c{=}j)-\widehat y_j\big) = -y_j + \widehat y_j \sum_c y_c = \widehat{y}_j - y_j,
\end{gathered}$$

using $\sum_c y_c = 1$. So $\delta_j^H = \widehat y_j - y_j$ holds for the squared loss with a linear output *and* for the cross-entropy loss with a softmax output: in both cases the error that starts the backward recursion is simply **prediction minus target**. This is not a coincidence — it holds for every matched pair of an exponential-family output layer and its negative log-likelihood loss.

# Implementation: A Multilayer Perceptron From Scratch

We now implement (F1)-(F2) and (B1)-(B4) literally, with no automatic differentiation anywhere: each layer is an object exposing a `forward` map and the corresponding explicitly coded `backward` map, and the optimizer is the four-line stochastic gradient step of the previous section. Two things are worth watching for in the code below.

* **Every `backward` is one of the identities above**, in the same order: `Affine.backward` implements (B3), (B4) and the factor $\mathbf{\Delta}^l W_l^\top$ of (B2); `ReLU.backward` supplies the remaining $\odot\, g'(\mathbf{Z})$ factor; `SoftmaxCrossEntropy.backward` is (B1).
* **The gradients are verified against finite differences.** Since we claim to have differentiated the network by hand, we check that claim numerically: for a random weight $w$, the central difference $\big(\widehat{R}(w{+}\epsilon)-\widehat{R}(w{-}\epsilon)\big)/(2\epsilon)$ must agree with the analytic gradient to within the $O(\epsilon^2)$ truncation error. This **gradient check** is the standard way to debug a hand-written backward pass, and is worth internalizing as a technique in its own right.

The data set is `digits`: $1797$ real handwritten digits scanned as $8\times8$ grayscale images ($d=64$ features, $C=10$ classes) — the same task as the MNIST example below, at a scale that trains from scratch in seconds.

![Learning curve of the from-scratch multilayer perceptron on the digits data set: training error reaches zero while test error settles near 3%.](fig/generated/08_Neural_Networks_2.png)

The analytic and numerical gradients agree to within $10^{-10}$, confirming that the four backward identities are implemented correctly. The learning curve shows the training error driven to exactly $0$ — the network has $64\cdot64 + 64\cdot32 + 32\cdot10 = 6{,}464$ weights against $m=1437$ training examples, so it can interpolate the training set outright — while the test error settles near $3\%$. This is the empirical form of the puzzle the next section addresses: a hypothesis class whose VC dimension far exceeds $m$, achieving $\widehat{R}_S(h)=0$, and generalizing anyway.

# PAC Analysis of Neural Networks

A two-layer network with $k$ hidden units and unconstrained real-valued weights has $O(k \cdot (d+1) + k)$ trainable parameters, and its VC dimension grows accordingly — for the sign-thresholded output of a network with piecewise-linear activations (e.g. ReLU), $d_{VC}$ scales at least linearly, and can scale super-linearly, in the number of weights. For any network wide enough to be useful in practice, this VC dimension vastly exceeds the number of training examples $m$, so the VC-dimension bound of Theorem 5.4 is **vacuous**: it promises nothing, since its right-hand side exceeds $1$. Yet, deep networks with far more parameters than training examples routinely generalize well. Resolving this puzzle needs a complexity measure that does not grow with the number of parameters — exactly the motivation behind Rademacher complexity (Chapter 5a). We now derive such a bound for a simplified network, using only the tools already built in Chapter 5a.

**Simplified setup.** Consider a network with a single hidden layer of $k$ units and a scalar output,

$$\begin{gathered}
h_{W,w}(x) = w^\top g(Wx), \\
W \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d},\ w \in \mathbb{R}^k,
\end{gathered}$$

where $g$ is applied elementwise. We assume:

* $g$ is $1$-Lipschitz with $g(0)=0$ — true for ReLU (and for $\tanh$, but *not* for the sigmoid, whose offset $g(0)=\tfrac12$ would need to be carried through the argument separately);
* every row $w_j^{(1)}$ of $W$ (the incoming weight vector of hidden unit $j$) satisfies $\|w_j^{(1)}\|_2 \leq B_1$;
* the output weights satisfy $\|w\|_2 \leq B_2$;
* $\|x\|_2 \leq R$ almost surely under $\mathcal{D}$.

Write $\mathcal{H}_{k,B_1,B_2}$ for the resulting hypothesis class. Note that $k$, $B_1$, $B_2$ are hyperparameters we are free to fix in advance — capping them plays exactly the role that capping the leaf budget $L$ played for decision trees in Chapter 7's own PAC analysis.

**Theorem 8.1 (Rademacher complexity of a two-layer network).**

$$\widehat{\mathfrak{R}}_S(\mathcal{H}_{k,B_1,B_2}) \leq \frac{\sqrt{k}\,B_1 B_2 R}{\sqrt{m}}.$$

**Proof.** Fix the sample $S = \{x_1,\ldots,x_m\}$. Since $h_{W,w}(x) = \sum_{j=1}^k w_j\, g(w_j^{(1)\top}x)$ is linear in $w$, the supremum over $\|w\|_2 \leq B_2$ of a linear functional is attained by Cauchy-Schwarz, for every fixed realization of the Rademacher signs $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_m$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\mathfrak{R}}_S(\mathcal{H}_{k,B_1,B_2}) &= \mathbb{E}_\sigma\Big[\sup_{W,w} \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m \sigma_i\, w^\top g(Wx_i)\Big] = \frac{B_2}{m}\, \mathbb{E}_\sigma\Big[\sup_{W} \Big\| \sum_{i=1}^m \sigma_i\, g(Wx_i) \Big\|_2\Big].
\end{aligned}
$$

Write $v_j(W) := \sum_i \sigma_i\, g(w_j^{(1)\top}x_i)$ for the $j$-th coordinate of the inner vector, where $w_j^{(1)}$ is the $j$-th row of $W$. Bounding the Euclidean norm by $\sqrt{k}$ times the sup-norm, and using that the $k$ rows range independently over identical $B_1$-balls (so the outer supremum and the coordinate-wise maximum commute),

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sup_{W} \big\| v(W) \big\|_2 &\leq \sqrt{k}\, \sup_{W} \max_{j} |v_j(W)| = \sqrt{k}\, \max_j \sup_{\|w_j^{(1)}\|_2 \leq B_1} |v_j(W)| \\
&= \sqrt{k}\, \sup_{\|u\|_2 \leq B_1} \Big|\sum_i \sigma_i\, g(u^\top x_i)\Big|,
\end{aligned}
$$

where the last equality holds because every one of the $k$ terms being maximized over is, by construction, the *same* scalar quantity — the row index $j$ only labels which weight vector we call $u$, the constraint set $\{\|u\|_2\le B_1\}$ and the data $x_1,\ldots,x_m$ being identical for every hidden unit. This collapses a $k$-fold maximum into a single scalar supremum, over a class with a single $B_1$-norm-bounded weight vector. Taking $\mathbb{E}_\sigma$ of both sides and recalling that $g$ is $1$-Lipschitz with $g(0)=0$, the contraction lemma (Lemma 5a.2, in the unsigned-but-$\phi(0){=}0$ form noted there) now applies validly — because it is invoked *after* the maximum has collapsed to a single scalar class, not pointwise inside a supremum over $k$ simultaneously varying rows:

$$\mathbb{E}_\sigma\Big[\sup_{\|u\|_2 \leq B_1} \Big|\sum_i \sigma_i\, g(u^\top x_i)\Big|\Big] \leq \mathbb{E}_\sigma\Big[\sup_{\|u\|_2 \leq B_1} \Big|\sum_i \sigma_i\, u^\top x_i\Big|\Big] = B_1\, \mathbb{E}_\sigma\Big[\Big\|\sum_i \sigma_i x_i\Big\|_2\Big],$$

the last equality by Cauchy-Schwarz. Finally, by Jensen's inequality and $\mathbb{E}[\sigma_i\sigma_{i'}]=0$ for $i\neq i'$,

$$\mathbb{E}_\sigma\Big[\Big\|\sum_i \sigma_i x_i\Big\|_2\Big] \leq \sqrt{\mathbb{E}_\sigma\Big[\Big\|\sum_i \sigma_i x_i\Big\|_2^2\Big]} = \sqrt{\sum_i \|x_i\|_2^2} \leq R\sqrt{m}.$$

Assembling the pieces, $\widehat{\mathfrak{R}}_S(\mathcal{H}_{k,B_1,B_2}) \leq \frac{B_2}{m}\cdot \sqrt{k}\,B_1 \cdot R\sqrt{m} = \frac{\sqrt{k}\,B_1B_2 R}{\sqrt{m}}$. $\square$

**Consequences.** Plugging Theorem 8.1 into Theorem 5a.2 (after one more application of the contraction lemma to pass from $\mathcal{H}_{k,B_1,B_2}$ to a Lipschitz loss composed with it) gives, with probability at least $1-\delta$, simultaneously for every $h \in \mathcal{H}_{k,B_1,B_2}$,

$$R(h) \leq \widehat{R}_S(h) + O\Big(\frac{\sqrt{k}\, B_1 B_2 R}{\sqrt{m}}\Big) + O\Big(\sqrt{\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{m}}\Big).$$

Three things are worth noting about this bound:

* It **does not depend on the input dimension $d$** — only on the per-neuron weight-norm bound $B_1$, the output-norm bound $B_2$, the data-norm bound $R$, and the width $k$. This is precisely the phenomenon flagged in Theorem 5a.4: capacity control by norm, rather than by counting parameters, is what makes the bound meaningful for models with far more parameters than $VC$-dimension arguments could ever tolerate.
* It scales with $\sqrt{k}$, not with the number of parameters $k(d+1)$. Width still costs something — but far less than a naive parameter-counting argument (à la Theorem 5.4) would suggest, and this residual $\sqrt k$ is itself an artifact of the crude row-independent decomposition step above; sharper arguments based on matrix covering numbers (Golowich, Rakhlin & Shamir, 2018) remove even this factor, at the cost of machinery beyond this course's scope.
* The bound gives no credit to gradient descent for finding a good hypothesis — it only certifies that *if* training happens to land on a hypothesis with small weight norms, that hypothesis generalizes well. This matches an empirical regularity of trained networks: gradient descent on over-parameterized networks tends to find solutions with small weight norms even without explicit regularization, an implicit-bias phenomenon that is an active research topic and, again, outside our scope — but it is exactly why this norm-based, width-independent view of capacity, rather than the VC-dimension view, is the one that matches practice. We revisit this network in a further-simplified, exactly solvable form — where only the output layer is trained and the hidden layer is fixed — in the Neural Tangent Kernel discussion of Chapter 9.

Nearly every neural network used nowadays is trained by minimizing a loss function using stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation. The common practice is to use an automatic differentiation library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch that automates the process of calculating the gradients. These libraries also provide a variety of neural network architectures and optimization algorithms. Below, we give an example implementation of a neural network using PyTorch on a handwritten digit classification problem. The used data set is among the most famous data sets in machine learning, called MNIST. It contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image. The goal is to classify the images into 10 classes, one for each digit.
